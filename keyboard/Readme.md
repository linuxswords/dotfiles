# keyboard layout store

For my beloved keyboard `keychron q11` I have created a keyboard layout via [via](https://caniusevia.com/) or the app directly: [app](https://www.usevia.app/).
# Installation

Use a browser that supports the `via` protocol, such as [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), meaning it has access to the usb protocol.

If you are running into erros, it is usually because via has no access to some u dev devices. Either open them or [install](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases/) the via desktop app and let the app fix it.

Save/load the json file for the layout.
